1. SQL, Structured Query Language, is a standard Language
for database creation and manipulation, while mySQL is a 
relational database program that usese SQL. A relational database
program allows us to identify and access data in relation to
another piece of data.
2. Normalization in SQL is organizing the columns and tables
of a database to ensure that the database integrity contraints
properly execute their dependencies.
3. A primary key is the field used to uniquely identify each
record in a table, it can not be null, must be unique, and 
there can only be one defined per table. A foreign key is a
field in one table that references the primary key in another table. 
The data from the fields are exactly the same, and the table with 
the primary key must exist first before the table of the foreign
key.
4. The three relationship types are one-to-one, in which for
every record in the primary table, there is only one and only one 
recordin the foreign table. One-to-many, in which for every record
in the primary table, there are one or more related records
in the foreign table. Many-to-Many, in which for every record
in the primary table, there are many related record in the foreign 
table, and for every foreign record in the foreign table, there is
many related records in the primary table.
5. The difference between LEFT join and INNER join is that a 
LEFT join returns all records from the left table, and matching records from
the right table, wile an INNER only returns records that match in both
tables.
