1) JavaScript is a a type of programming language. It is used commonly to add dynamic interactions 
to web pages, apllications, and games. Iterpreted language differs from compile language because a different program, 
the interpreter reads and executes the code, languages such as JS or Python. The compiler is the program that express in
the taget machine, and it is undecipherable, such as c++ or Java.

2) During dynamically type programming, the type checking occurs when the code is running, having a higher chance of run
time errors, but allowing more flexible variable usage, while Statically type programming, the type checking occurs during
compilation, allowing it to catch more errors and improving run time. A Strongly typed prevent accidental type mismatches by 
requiring explicit conversions between types, while a weakly typed can lead to unexpected events since it is allowed to allow 
implicit type conversions.

3) A var declaration is a global function scope that is able to be redeclared, let is a declaration that is block scope that is
able to be redeclared, and const is a block scope that is not allowed to be redeclared. 

4) An anonymous function is a function that has no name. A higher-function is a function that can take in other functions or
return other functions as arguments called a. Callback functions is passed as an argument to another function to be called
later. First-class functions are if functions that are treated like other variables. 

5) Objects are a collection of data, or property, and a property is an association between a aname and a value.
