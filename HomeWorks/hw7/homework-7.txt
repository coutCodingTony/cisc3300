1. A class is a template for creating objects and it is required unlike JS.
An object is an instance of a class. An OOP, Object-Oriented Programming
uses objects to design computer programs.
2. Abstract classes allow the parent to create defaults for methods
by only extending by children classes.
3. Superglobal are variables that are available in all scopes 
throughout a script. One example of the data they provide is
the $_SERVER superblobal, which creates a PHP interperter superglobal array
each time a page is requested.
4. The two steps to setting up and using a class via namespace
are 1. Defining a namespace in the class to be used, 2. $postModel = new/place/holder/Post().
5. MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three
main logical components, Model, View, and Controller.
Model: corresponds to all the data related logic that the user interacts with.
It can add and retrieve data from the database, and responds to the
Controller's request.
View: used for all UI logic, providing the user with an interface.
Created from the data from the model, given to it by the controller. 
Can only interact with the controller.
Controller: Enables the interconnection between model and view.
Does not handle data logic, just gives the model instruction of
what to do. Manipulates the data using the model and renders the data through 
view.
